# Responsive sidebars
This project is somewhat of a research experiment
into the most convenient way of implementing responsive sidebars.

## Priorities
* Simple design, easy to understand.
* Responsive design:
    - In landscape mode the sidebars should push the main content aside.
    - In portrait mode they should cover the main content.
* The sidebar trigger should *not* move when clicked;
  this is annoying to the user.
* The sidebar should be 'ready' when it slides into view,
  and not rearrange its content while opening.  
  (This is visually distracting, but a very common implementation;  
  e.g. variable-width sidebars with `width: 0` when closed)

## Design
The code is deliberately kept minimal to not distract from the
sidebar mechanics.  
The main version uses **flexbox**, but there are other branches
exploring CSS grid and absolute positioning.

**3 flex items** are used for their adaptive features:
the sidebars **`#left`** and **`#right`**, and the main content **`#main`**.  
This allows pushing the main content aside when the landscape sidebars open
(by transitioning the `#left` and `#right` widths).
However, since we want the sidebars to be fixed-width, so they do not
rearrange their content while opening, the actual sidebars are not these
variable-width flex items, but child divs with fixed widths.

As a result, the sidebars make use of **2 separate transitions**:
- One to push the main content aside when the sidebars open in landscape mode,  
  by **transitioning the `#left` and `#right` flex items' width** from 0 to the
  sidebar width.
- Another to slide the (portrait and landscape) fixed-width sidebar child divs
  in and out of view,  
  by **transitioning their `transform: translateX(-100%)` property**.
